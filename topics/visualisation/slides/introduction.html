## Genomic Data Visualisation in Galaxy


Tool      | Use Case
--------- | ---------
UCSC      | Visualising interval data on the main UCSC site
IGB / IGV | Locally visualising interval and pileup data, analysing variants
JBrowse   | Web genome browser similar to IGB/IGV (workflow compatible)
Circos    | Circular plots (nearly) ready for publication (workflow compatible)

???
[something about ucsc / igb / igv.]
[as far as I care trackster/circster don't exist since they aren't WF compatible / there are many pros to the tools.]

The JBrowse and Circos tools can provide workflow compatible tools to help summarize tens to hundreds of datasets within a single graphic that researchers can interpret. This can provide much need visual context that separate files or large textual reports cannot.
